  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <!-- EDIT THIS: Mission Text -->
  <p>
    Tiger 1 Corp. is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing youth in the Atlanta area with access
    to sports training, mentorship, and safe athletic development—regardless of financial circumstances.
    While we started with baseball, we aim to offer basketball, football, and other sports opportunities
    as we grow. Our goal is to empower youth, build confidence, and foster teamwork through athletics.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <!-- EDIT THIS: Vision Text -->
  <p>
    Our long-term vision is to establish a community-based indoor sports facility that provides
    year-round access to baseball, basketball, football, and other athletic programs. This space
    will serve as a safe, structured environment for skill development, mentorship, and life skills.

  <h2>Why We Started</h2>
  <!-- EDIT THIS: Personal Story -->
  <p>
    Tiger 1 Corp. was founded to address the lack of accessible athletic programs for underserved
    youth in the Atlanta area. We believe every child deserves a place to learn, grow, and play,
    regardless of their family’s financial situation.
